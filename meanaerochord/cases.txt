B-2 wing (approximate)
From the sketch of the wing in cases.pdf, one can see that the right wing is
defined by four chords. The root chord at y=0 with xle=0 has a chord of 130.
The tip chord, at y=120 with xle=100 has a chord of 0. The other two chords
require a little calculation. The third chord at y=90 has xte=125, but we
do not have the x-coordinate of the leading edge. This is exactly the sort 
of problem for which LinIntrp was designed. The leading edge is defined by
points (0,0,0) and (100,120,0). By specifying the y-coordinate (=90) of the 
xle point we desire, we immediately see that it is 75. The second chord at
y=48 has xte=90 and if we insert y=48 into the y-input box for LinInterp, we
see that its leading edge x-coordinate is 40. So, the input data for getMAC is:

&chord   y=0, xle=0,   c=130/
&chord  y=48, xle=40,  c=50/
&chord  y=90, xle=75,  c=50/
&chord y=120, xle=100, c=0/


F-117 wing (approximate)
The root chord is defined by xle=0, y=0, c=1120. The tip chord is at 
xle=860,y=500 and has c=0. The other two chords must be computed. If we use
LinIntrp and define the leading edge with the two points at the root and tip
chords, then inserting y=200 gives xle=344 and hence c=400. Similarly, setting
y=375 gives xle=645 and again c=400.

The input to getMac becomes
   &chord    y=0, xle=0,   c=1120/
   &chord  y=200, xle=344, c=400/
   &chord  y=375, xle=645, c=400/
   &chord  y=500, xle=860, c=0/

The oblique wing case is one where you know all the chords. The symmetrical
cases use the chords on the right wing only. You could put in all of the chords,
both left and right and you would get the same answers for xle and xte of the
mean aerodynamic chord. Of course, it would have y=0. The area printed would be
that of the whole wing. When you use getMac on the right wing only, the area
printed is that of the right wing only.
