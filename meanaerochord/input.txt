INPUT DATA FOR MEANAEROCHORD                                       /meanaerochord/input.txt

GetMAC is a Modern Fortran program that uses namelist input.
Each chord of the wing requires a &chord namelist record.
There are three variables that may appear on the 
input record:
   y   the y-coordinate of the chord
  xle  the x-coordinate of the leading edge of the chord
   c   the length of the chord

Any units may be used. Of course, the same units must be 
used for all three variables.

In accordance with the Fortran standard (as of 1990), the
namelist is terminated with a slash (/).
Any text preceeding the &chord text is ignored as commentary.

An example case:


This is a wing that resembles the B-2
&chord  y=0,  xle=0,   c=130/
&chord  y=48, xle=40,  c=50/
&chord  y=90, xle=75,  c=50/
&chord y=120, xle=100, c=0/
