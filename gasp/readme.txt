Note that Gasp is not a program, but a subroutine package to be used
in your own work. The little programs program1.f90, etc. are examples
of the use of Gasp.
  
This program is quite well known and can be incorporated into your
programs if you need thermodynamic or transport properties. The samples 
and problems that were not included with the COSMIC distribution are from
the NASA report TN D-7808. GASP was released in 1971 as Cosmic Program 
11629 from NASA Lewis Research Center.

You might note a bug in the printed report for the output for Problem 2.
The exhaust temperature is 188.437 kelvins, but the printed value is 88.43.
This happened because the output format was F5.2 and no error was noted.
Fortran has improved a lot since 1971.
