PABLO.TXT  USAGE

Program facilities :

Three different kinds of geometries are implemented : 
- Ellipse with prescribed axis ratio,
- NACA 4 digits airfoil library
- General airfoil library.

In the two first cases, the shape of the object is defined
analytically. The user simply has to enter the proper information,
ellipse axis ratio or Naca 4 digits.

In the last case, the airfoils are defined in data files using
a number of discrete points. Around 70 airfoils taken from well
known shape libraries are already recorded and ready to use. New
data files can be added to the library with any airfoil 
coordinates except that the airfoil trailing edge must be sharp.

Three different kinds of singularities are implemented:
- Constant-strength sources,
- Constant-strength doublets,
- Linear vortices.

The user may change the flow angle of attack and Reynolds Number,
as well as the number of panels used in the discretization.

The solution computed by the program features : 
- The Cp distribution,
- The aerodynamics coefficients CL, CD and CM,
- The coordinate of the center of pressure Xcp,
- The location of transition and eventual laminar or turbulent
  separation,
- The distribution of the boundary layer parameters.

Miscellaneous :

It is possible to zoom in and out on the 2D plot. Get
information by entering "help zoom" in Matlab.
It is also possible to hold on the previous plot by clicking on
the button "Hold on (Cp)"
This is allowed only between solutions on the same geometry and
at the same angle of attack.
