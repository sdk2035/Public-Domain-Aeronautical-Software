The input to ATC is contained in four different files

The main ATC file has three records

Record 1: Aircraft identifier  (80 characters)
Record 2: dt,ws,clao,alpha0,var (free format)
Record 3: nr,nv,nd,nh (free format)
  where
    dt      = time difference, seconds
    ws      = wing loading (weight/wingArea), pounds per square foot
    clao    = lift-curve slope, per degree
    alpha0  = angle of attack for zero lift, degrees
    var     = magnetic var., degrees
    nr      = number of points for smoothing pre-smooth
    nv      = number of points for smoothing ground speed
    nd      = number of points for smoothing track angle
    nh      = number of points for smoothing altitude

The wind file consists of wind direction and velocity as well as
temperature for a number of altitudes. Each record has four data points,
all real in free format, separated by blanks
  altitude, thousands of feet   
  wind direction, degrees
  wind velocity, knots
  temperature, degrees F
There may be up to 20 records in the wind file.

The radar file consists of position data for the aircraft as a
time history. Each record has six data points:
  time, hours    (integer)
  time, minutes  (integer)
  time, seconds  (integer)
  x-range, nautical miles  (real)
  y-range, nautical miles  (real)
  altitude, feet           (real) 
There may be up to 300 points in the radar file.

The plot file consists of descriptions of the plotting parameters for each
plot to be printed in the output file. Each plot description is made up of
two records in format (I10,A30,2F10.2)

  Record 1: ny, nwy, start,stop
  Record 2: nx, nwx, startx, stopx


There may be any number of plots.
