Note that Fluid is not a program, but a subroutine package for you
to include in your own work. The little programs sample.f90 and
samprlc.f90 are examples of the use of Fluid.

From the COSMIC description...

The accurate computation of the thermodynamic and transport properties of 
fluids is a necessity for many engineering calculations. The FLUID program 
was developed to calculate the thermodynamic and transport properties of 
pure fluids in both the liquid and gas phases. Fluid properties are 
calculated using a simple gas model, empirical corrections, and an efficient 
numerical interpolation scheme. FLUID produces results that are in very good 
agreement with measured values, while being much faster than older more 
complex programs developed for the same purpose.

A Van der Waals equation of state model is used to obtain approximate state 
values. These values are corrected for real gas effects by model correction 
factors obtained from tables based on experimental data. These tables also 
accurately compensate for the special circumstances which arise whenever 
phase conditions occur. Viscosity and thermal conductivity values are 
computed directly from tables. Interpolation within tables is based on 
Lagrange's three point formula. A set of tables must be generated for each 
fluid implemented.

FLUID currently contains tables for nine fluids including dry air and steam. 
The user can add tables for any fluid for which adequate thermal property 
data is available. The FLUID routine is structured so that it may easily be 
incorporated into engineering programs. FLUID was released in 1977 as Cosmic 
Program LEW-14418 from NASA Lewis Research Center.
