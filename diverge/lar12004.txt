 AEROELASTIC DIVERGENCE CHARACTERISTICS OF UNGUIDED, SLENDER BODY, 
MULTI-STAGE LAUNCH VEHICLES

( NASA Langley Research Center )

The primary function of this computer program is the calculation of the
divergence dynamic pressure and associated divergence modal 
characteristics of unguided, slender-body, multistage launch vehicles. 
The divergence dynamic pressure is obtained as the non-trivial solution 
to a homogenous stability equation using matrix recurrence techniques. 
Provision is made for modulating the distributed lift curve coefficient 
slope function and the stiffness function. The program also includes an 
option for calculating a generalized static margin which approximates 
the degeneration in rigid-body static margin due to aeroelasticity 
effects. Evaluated equations are also programmed to allow for the 
exclusion of the effect of aerodynamic crossflow resulting from vehicle 
angular velocities if desired. Other physical and aerodynamic properties 
calculated include total mass, center of mass, moments of inertia in 
pitch about the reference station, total aerodynamic lift curve slope, 
static aerodynamic center of pressure, rigid body static margin, and 
short period frequency. Input to the program is via the Fortran 
NAMELIST option with output printed.

The program is written in CDC Fortran IV (Version 2.3) and has been im-
plemented on a CDC 6600 computer under the SCOPE 3.2 monitor in central mem-
ory field lengths less than 57K octal 60 bit words.
