The files for this program are in the directory ablate
  readme.txt      this file of general description
  original.src    the original copy of the source code (from COSMIC)
  lew00240.txt    the original program description from COSMIC
  ablate.f90      the source code converted to modern Fortran
  case1.inp       input for test case 1
  case1.out       output for test case 1
  case2.inp       input for test case 2
  case2.out       output for test case 2
  case5.inp       input for test case 5
  case5.out       output for test case 5

This program is a "work in progress" and is not ready for general release.
I have included it so those who have a special interest may see
the original code plus my modifications to date. Without further documentation
it is hard to tell if this program is working properly or not.

Any help would be appreciated.
