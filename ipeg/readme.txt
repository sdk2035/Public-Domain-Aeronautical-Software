This program is written in Turbo Pascal and may be difficult to compile today.
I used to do a lot with Turbo Pascal and still use Delphi. If you want to
try to do something with this program, send me a message at 
pdaerowebmaster@gmail.com and I will try to give you a hand.

This program is a "work in progress" and is not ready for general release.
I have included it so those who have a special interest may see
the original code plus my modifications to date.
