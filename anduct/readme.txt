This program is a "work in progress" and is not ready for general release.
I have included it so those who have a special interest may see
the original code plus my modifications to date.

There are numerous references associated with this program. Links to these
may be found at https://www.pdas.com/anductrefs.html.

To compile this program for your machine, use the command
   gfortran  an.f90 -o an.exe
Linux and Macintosh users may prefer to omit the .exe on the file name.
