 TRANSIENT RESPONSE OF ABLATING AXISYMMETRIC BODIES INCLUDING THE 
EFFECTS OF SHAPE CHANGE

( NASA Langley Research Center )

     A computer program has been developed to analyze the transient 
response of an ablating axisymmetric body, including the effect of 
shape change. The governing differential equation, the boundary 
conditions for the analysis on which the computer program is based, 
and the method of solution of the resulting finite-difference 
equations are discussed in the documentation.

     Some of the features of the analysis and the associated program 
are 
 (1) the ablation material is considered to be orthotropic with 
temperature-dependent thermal properties; 
 (2) the thermal response of the entire body is considered 
simultaneously; 
 (3) the heat transfer and pressure distribution over the body are 
adjusted to the new geometry as ablation occurs; 
 (4) the governing equations and several boundary-condition options 
are formulated in terms of generalized orthogonal coordinates for 
fixed points in a moving coordinate system; 
 (5) the finite-difference equations are solved implicitly; and 
 (6) other instantaneous body shapes can be displayed with a
user-supplied plotting routine.

     The physical problem to be modeled with the analysis is described
by FORTRAN input variables. For example, the external body geometry is 
described in the W, Z coordinates; material density is given; and the 
stagnation cold-wall heating rate is given in a time-dependent array. 
Other input variables are required which control the solution, specify 
boundary conditions, and determine output from the program. The 
equations have been programmed so that either the International System 
of Units or the U. S. Customary Units may be used.

     This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has 
been implemented on a CDC 6000 Series computer. This program was 
developed in 1972.
