This program works by reading a file of input commands and making
wings or bodies that satisify the defining parameters. The two
command words WING and BODY actually create a network. They will
use the parameters that have been previously defined. If more
components are desired, the commands that have already been defined
will remain in effect until superceded.

Command words are:

BODY    completes a body
WING    completes a wing
TITLE   the name of the LaWGS object
SHAPE     the body shape; =0 cone; =1 parabolic; =2 Sears-Haack;
          =3 von Karman ogive; =4 ellipsoid
NFS       number of fugelage stations defining the body
NTHETA    number of longitudinal lines on HALF the body        
ROWS      number of rows of panels on a wing
COLS      number of columns of panels on a wing
IROOT     root spacing rule
ITIP      tip spacing rule
ISPAN     span spacing rule
SECTION   airfoil section code; =0 parabolic arc; =1 double wedge;
          =2 30-70 hex; =4 wedge (thick base); =5 NACA 4-digit
SECT      alternate spelling for SECTION      
LEFTTIP   logical variable. Make a network that closes the left tip
          of the current wing network. TCROOT must be > 0 and the
          length of the root chord must be positive. 
          The  normal vector (PanAir convention) will point to the left.
RIGHTTIP  logical variable. Make a network that closes the right tip
          of the current wing network. TCTIP must be > 0 and the
          length of the tip chord must be positive.
          The normal vector (PanAir convention) will point to the right.
LNOSE     length of the nose
LBODY     length of the body
LTAIL     length of the afterbody or tail section
RNOSE     radius at the start of the nose
RADIUS    radius of the cylindrical portion of the body 
RBASE     radius at the end of the tail section of the body
XNOSE     x-coordinate of the nose
ZNOSE     z-coordinate of the nose
ZBASE     z-coordinate of the end of the tail
YNOSE     y-coordinate of the axis of the  body
ROOTLE    x-coordinate of the  root leading edge
LEROOT    alternate spelling for ROOTLE
ROOTTE    x-coordinate of the root trailing edge
TEROOT    alternate spelling of ROOTTE
ROOTY     y-coordinate of the root chord
YROOT     alternate spelling of ROOTY
ROOTZ     z-coordinate of the root chord
ZROOT     alternate spelling of ROOTZ
TIPLE     x-coordinate of the tip leading edge
LETIP     alternate spelling of TIPLE 
TIPTE     x-coordinate of the tip trailing edge
TETIP     alternate spelling of TIPTE 
TIPY      y-coordinate of the tip chord
YTIP      alternate spelling of YTIP
TIPZ      z-coordinate of the tip chord
ZTIP      alternate spelling of ZTIP
TCROOT    t/c of the root chord  (fraction, not percent)
TCTIP     t/c of the tip chord  (fraction, not percent)
