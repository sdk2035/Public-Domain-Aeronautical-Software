MISLIFT- AERODYNAMIC LIFT ON WING-BODY COMBINATIONS AT SMALL ANGLES OF
ATTACK IN SUPERSONIC FLOW

( NASA Langley Research Center )

Two separate and distinct theories are incorporated in this computer program 
to estimate the lift-induced pressures existent on a wing-body combination. 
These are (1) the second-order shock-expansion theory, which is used to obtain
the lifting pressures on the body alone at small angles of attack, and (2) the 
linear-theory integral equations, which is used to evaluate the lifting 
pressures induced by the wing.

These equations relate the local surface slope at a point on the lifting 
surface to the pressure differential at the point and the influence of the 
pressures upstream of the point. The numerical solution of these equations 
is effected by treating the wing-planform as a composite of elemental
rectangles and applying summation techniques to satisfy the necessary 
integral relations.

Most of the input required by this program is involved with the description 
of the missile planform geometry. The output consists of the computed value 
of the lifting pressure slope (the differential pressure coefficient per 
degree angle of attack) for each of the elements in the planform array. A 
force and moment summary is presented for the configuration under 
consideration.
