The program called "induced" will enable you to compute the lift and
drag coefficients corresponding to a given span load distribution,
either symmetric or asymmetric. This program uses an input data file
and writes an output file describing the computed results.

INPUT DATA FOR THE INDUCED DRAG PROGRAM

TITLE  < any descriptive title >
SPAN   < the full wing span, not semispan >
SREF   < the wing reference area >
ASYM   < if this record is present, the loading is asymmetric.
         if this record is not present, the loading is symmetric >
TERMS  < number of terms to be computed in the Fourier series >
LOADING
       < followed by any number of (y,ccl) loading pairs >

note that all the data is dimensional. SPAN and all elements of loading 
have units of length, and SREF has units of area.
The first five records may be in any order and are optional
If TERMS is not supplied, it is set to twice the number of loading pairs.
If either SPAN or SREF is missing, a value of 1.0 is assumed. The title
is blank if not supplied.
LOADING is not optional and must be the last keyword input.
The keywords may be upper or lower case.
Several sample cases (case1.ccl, case2.ccl, etc. are included to 
illustrate the usage.
