There is no documentation or instructions for the use of this program
in the NASA distribution. But we can figure out quite a bit just by
reading the source code. All I can say is that I will try to nail down
just what the input files represent. I have only been working on this
code for a short time. Added 1 Jan 2004: Well it has been some time
now and I still don't understand most of the variables. But I am not
giving up. Somehow, this never gets to the top of the priority stack.
