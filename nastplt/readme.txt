 NASTRAN NASTPLT PLOTTING POST PROCESSOR                    /nastplt/readme.txt

The files for this program are in the directory nastplt 
  gsc12833.txt    the original program description from COSMIC
  readme.txt      this file of general description
  original.src    the original copy of the source code (from COSMIC)


This program is a "work in progress" and is not ready for general release.
I have included it so those who have a special interest may see
the original code plus my modifications to date.
I have been informed that this code assumes an older formatting of NASTRAN
files and will not work with the current standard.
It appears that the only value of this program is as a guide towards the 
coding of a modern version. If someone is up to doing this, I will be happy
to give it wide distribution.
